Subject code on the first line.
Each subsequent line, 6 comma separated unsigned integers describing stimulation limits on a bipolar pair:
first_channel_one_indexed,second_channel_one_indexed,max_amplitude_in_uA,min_frequency_in_Hz,max_frequency_in_Hz,max_duration_in_ms,area_in_mm_squared

Communication protocol, port 8901:

Initialization procedure:

Elemem sends subject code:
R1999J

Stim process sends either:
SPREADY,StimProc,Fri Apr  8 13:25:50 2022
or
SPERROR,Subject code R1999T does not match configuration code R1999J

Afterward, Elemem configures stim with:

SPSTIMCONFIG,1,1,2,500,200,2000
 - Note:  Number sequence is:
    - Number of channels to stimulate on when started.
      - Channel number in bipolar pair which should go positive first.
      - Channel number in bipolar pair which should go negative first.
      - Amplitude in microamps.
      - Frequency in Hertz.
      - Duration in milliseconds.

SPSTIMTHETACONFIG,1,1,2,500,200,3,0.25
 - For configuring theta-burst stim.
 - Note:  Number sequence is:
    - Number of channels to stimulate on when started.
      - Channel number in bipolar pair which should go positive first.
      - Channel number in bipolar pair which should go negative first.
      - Amplitude in microamps.
      - Frequency in Hertz of the FAST component, usually 200Hz.  Note that
        this is NOT the theta-burst frequency, which is produced externally by
        calling SPSTIMSTART multiple times.
      - Theta-burst envelope frequency, e.g. 3Hz.
      - Burst-on fraction within each theta-burst envelope, usually 0.25.
        e.g. for a 3Hz theta burst SPTIMSTART is called every 1/3 of a second,
        approximately 333ms, and for 0.25 each SPSTIMSTART should trigger a
        single 0.25*(1/3) seconds of stimulation pulses, or about 83.3ms at
        the fast frequency (e.g. 200Hz).

Valid responses:

SPSTIMCONFIGDONE
SPSTIMCONFIGERROR,One-line comma-free error message.

Stim is initiated with:

SPSTIMSTART

Valid responses:

SPSTIMSTARTDONE
SPSTIMSTARTERROR,One-line comma-free error message.

Other error conditions from the stim process:

SPERROR,One-line other condition comma-free error message.
