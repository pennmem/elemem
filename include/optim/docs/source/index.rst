Introduction
============

OptimLib is a lightweight C++ library of numerical optimization methods for nonlinear functions.

Features:

- A C++11 library of local and global optimization algorithms, as well as root finding techniques.

- Derivative-free optimization using advanced, parallelized metaheuristic methods.

- Constrained optimization routines to handle simple box constraints, as well as systems of nonlinear constraints.

- For fast and efficient matrix-based computation, OptimLib supports the following templated linear algebra libraries:

  - `Armadillo <http://arma.sourceforge.net/>`_ 

  - `Eigen <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php>`_ 

- OpenMP-accelerated algorithms for parallel computation. 

- Straightforward linking with parallelized BLAS libraries, such as `OpenBLAS <https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS>`_.

- Available as a header-only library, or as a compiled shared library.

- Released under a permissive, non-GPL license.
